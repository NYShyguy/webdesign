    <h1>Hello, Professor</h1>
    <p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
    <br>
    <p>1. A creative web project is such a widely applicable phrase that can apply to art, data visualizations, games, etc. It is anything that uses the web as its medium to display
      utility/art and uses the unique aspects of the web to enhance itself.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. I would like to use the web to display a video game. A game that can be played on the web can effectively be played anywhere without installation or price, so I want to publish
      something that is very self aware of the medium that it is in. Alternatively, I would like to use the web to make creative ventures easier. Giving people tools through the web,
      once again, bypasses the need for installation or payment, so it could be a very effective means to publish tools.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. In this course I would like to have competency about web publishing enough so that whatever projects I want to make for myself with my own programming experience,
      I can easily share with friends by implementing it into a website. Whether that be a game or a creative tool, I would like this class to shatter the burden of accessibility through
      web publishing.</p>
